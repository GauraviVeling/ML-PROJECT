# ML-PROJECT

## Purchase Behavior Prediction

### Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will make a purchase based on their details. It uses a dataset with information like age, salary, and price to classify purchase behavior. The project includes steps for selecting important features, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and making predictions based on user input.

### Key Features
- **Feature Selection:** Identifies important features using a Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Trains and tests two models:
  1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Uses a linear approach with probability estimates.
  2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Makes predictions based on the most common outcome among nearest neighbors.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses and compares the performance of both SVM and KNN models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Provides visualizations of confusion matrices for both models to evaluate their prediction performance.
- **User Input Prediction:** Allows users to input their details to get predictions from both models and shows which model is preferred.
